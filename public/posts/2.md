# Deploying a Serverless API with Cloudflare Workers

Serverless computing has revolutionized how we deploy applications. Cloudflare Workers takes this a step further by running your code on the edge network, closer to your users than ever before.

## Why Cloudflare Workers?

1. **Low Latency:** Code runs in data centers worldwide.
2. **No Cold Starts:** Unlike AWS Lambda, the isolate model ensures instant execution.
3. **Cheaper:** Generous free tier and low cost per request.

## Example: A Simple JSON API

Here is how easy it is to return JSON data:

```javascript
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const data = {
      message: "Hello from the Edge!",
      timestamp: Date.now()
    };

    return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), {
      headers: {
        "content-type": "application/json",
      },
    });
  },
};
```

## Wrangler CLI

Using the `wrangler` CLI makes deployment a breeze:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

That's it. Your API is globally distributed in seconds.
