# Away’s Expandable Suitcases Are Here

**Travel gear just got a significant upgrade.**

For years, digital nomads and frequent flyers have faced a dilemma: checking a bag or cramming everything into a carry-on. The new expandable line from Away aims to solve this.

## Why Flexibility Matters

When you are on the road for months, you acquire things. Souvenirs, new gear, or just extra snacks. A rigid suitcase restricts you.

### Key Features
* **Durable polycarbonate shell** that flexes under pressure.
* **Whisper-quiet wheels** that glide over cobblestones.
* **1.75" expansion** which translates to roughly 3-4 extra outfits.

> "The ability to expand your carry-on means you can pack light for the flight there, and bring back gifts on the flight home."

## Conclusion

If you prioritize versatility, this might be the best investment for your 2024 travels.
