# Minimalist Desk Setup for Productivity

A cluttered desk is a cluttered mind. In this post, I'll walk you through my current setup designed for deep work and coding.

## The Essentials

### 1. The Monitor
I use a single 32-inch 4K monitor. It provides enough real estate for split-screen coding without the neck strain of dual monitors.

### 2. The Keyboard
A mechanical keyboard (Keychron Q1) offers tactile feedback that makes typing enjoyable.

### 3. Lighting
A monitor light bar saves desk space and reduces eye strain during late-night coding sessions.

## Cable Management
The trick to a clean look is hiding cables. 
* Use **velcro ties**.
* Mount a **power strip** under the desk.
* Use a **wireless mouse**.
