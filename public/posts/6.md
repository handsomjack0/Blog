# The Future of AI in Software Engineering

The release of GPT-4 and tools like GitHub Copilot has sparked a debate: **Will AI replace software engineers?**

## The Shift from Coding to Problem Solving

Historically, a developer's value was tied to their knowledge of syntax and libraries. 
* "How do I reverse a binary tree in C++?"
* "What is the boilerplate for Redux?"

AI answers these instantly.

## The New Skillset

The engineer of the future will focus on:
1. **System Architecture**: Designing how components fit together.
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Knowing how to ask AI correctly.
3. **Code Review**: Verifying AI output for security and logic flaws.

## Conclusion

AI won't replace developers. **Developers using AI will replace developers who don't.** The role is evolving from "Bricklayer" to "Architect."
