# Understanding React Server Components

React Server Components (RSC) represent a paradigm shift in how we build React applications. They allow components to render exclusively on the server, reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client.

## The Problem with Client-Side Rendering

In traditional SPA (Single Page Application) architectures, the browser downloads a large bundle, executes it, fetches data, and then renders. This leads to:
- High Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Layout shifts
- SEO challenges

## How RSC Helps

With RSC, data fetching happens directly on the server.

```javascript
// This component runs ONLY on the server
import db from './database';

async function NoteList() {
  const notes = await db.query('SELECT * FROM notes');

  return (
    <ul>
      {notes.map(note => (
        <li key={note.id}>{note.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## Hybrid Apps

The future is hybrid: Server Components for data-heavy views, and Client Components for interactive elements (like buttons and inputs).
