# Kubernetes for Beginners: Pods and Services

Kubernetes (K8s) can be intimidating. Let's break down the two most fundamental concepts: **Pods** and **Services**.

## What is a Pod?

A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. Think of it as a wrapper around a single container (or a small group of tightly coupled containers).

* Pods are ephemeral (they die properly).
* Pods get their own IP address.

## What is a Service?

If Pods die and get new IPs, how do you talk to them? Enter **Services**.

A Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
```

This YAML ensures that traffic to `my-service` is load-balanced across all healthy pods labeled `app: MyApp`.
